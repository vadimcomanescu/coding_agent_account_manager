> **Sub-100ms account switching for AI coding CLIs with fixed-cost subscription plans. When you hit usage limits on Claude Max, GPT Pro, or Gemini Ultra, don't wait 60 seconds for browser OAuth—just swap to another account instantly.**

```bash
curl -fsSL "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Dicklesworthstone/coding_agent_account_manager/main/install.sh?$(date +%s)" | bash
```

Usage:

```bash
caam backup claude alice@gmail.com      # Save current auth
caam activate claude bob@gmail.com      # Switch instantly
```

---

## 🤖 Agent Quickstart (JSON)

**Use `--json` in agent contexts.** stdout = data, stderr = diagnostics, exit 0 = success.

```bash
# List available profiles (machine-readable)
caam list --json

# Show current status for all tools
caam status --json

# Switch accounts
caam activate claude alice@gmail.com --json
```

---

## The Problem

You're paying $200-275/month for fixed-cost AI coding subscriptions (Claude Max, GPT Pro, Gemini Ultra). These plans have usage limits—not billing caps, but rate limits that reset over time. When you hit them mid-flow, the official way to switch accounts:

```
/login → browser opens → sign out of Google → sign into different Google →
authorize app → wait for redirect → back to terminal
```

**That's 30-60 seconds of friction.** Multiply by 5+ switches per day across multiple tools.

## The Solution

Each AI CLI stores OAuth tokens in plain files. `caam` backs them up and restores them:

```bash
caam activate claude bob@gmail.com   # ~50ms, done
```

No browser. No OAuth dance. No interruption to your flow state.

## How It Works

    style System fill:#1a1a2e,stroke:#4a4a6a,color:#fff
    style Vault fill:#16213e,stroke:#4a4a6a,color:#fff
```

**That's it.** No external database servers (uses embedded SQLite), no required daemons (optional background service available). Just `cp` with extra steps.

### Why This Works

OAuth tokens are bearer tokens—possession equals access. The CLI tools don't fingerprint your machine beyond what's already in the token file. Swapping files is equivalent to "being" that authenticated session.

### Profile Detection

`caam status` uses **content hashing** to detect the active profile:

1. SHA-256 hash current auth files
2. Compare against all vault profiles
3. Match = that's what's active

This means:
- Profiles are detected even if you switched manually
- No hidden state files that can desync
- Works correctly after reboots

---

## Three Operating Modes

### 1. Vault Profiles (Simple Switching)

Swap auth files in place. One account active at a time per tool. Instant switching.

```bash
caam backup claude work@company.com
caam activate claude personal@gmail.com
```

**Use when:** You want to switch between accounts sequentially (most common use case).

### 2. Isolated Profiles (Parallel Sessions)

Run multiple accounts **simultaneously** with full directory isolation.

```bash
caam profile add codex work@company.com
caam profile add codex personal@gmail.com
caam exec codex work@company.com -- "implement feature X"
caam exec codex personal@gmail.com -- "review code"
```

Each profile gets its own `$HOME` and `$CODEX_HOME` with symlinks to your real `.ssh`, `.gitconfig`, etc.

**What is and isn't isolated inside a profile:**

| Path | Treatment | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Provider auth dirs (`~/.claude` credentials, `~/.config/claude-code`, `$CODEX_HOME`, `~/.gemini`, `~/.config/opencode`, ...) | isolated (real dirs) | The whole point: per-account credentials. |
| `~/.ssh`, `~/.gitconfig`, `~/.gnupg`, `~/.aws`, `~/.cargo`, `~/.npm`, `~/.local/bin` | symlink → real home | Dev tooling passes through. |
| Other `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME` entries (`gh`, `atuin`, `uv`, `shopify-*`, ...) | per-entry symlink → real `~/.config` | XDG-based CLIs keep their credentials — without this, `gh` silently logs out and `git push` fails with `could not read Username for 'https://github.com'` (issue #69). |
| Other `~/.local/share` and `~/.local/state` entries (`com.vercel.cli`, `supabase`, ...) | per-entry symlink → real home | Same: `HOME` redirection silently relocates the XDG data/state dirs. |
| `~/.local/share/caam` | never passed through | Contains the vault and every profile's credentials. |
| Claude `~/.claude/skills`, `plugins`, `commands`, `agents` | symlink → real home | User tooling, not account state — shared so sessions inside a profile keep their skills. |

Passthrough symlinks are refreshed on every `caam exec`, so tools installed after profile creation are picked up automatically.

**Use when:** You need two accounts running at the same time in different terminals.

### 3. Shallow Profiles (Concurrent Multi-Account Multiplexing)

A "shallow" `$HOME` per identity: only the auth-bearing files are real, **everything else is a symlink back to your real `~/`**. Designed for orchestrators that fan N parallel agent sessions across N accounts on the same machine.

**Supported providers:** `claude`, `codex`, and `agy` (Antigravity). Each provider keeps only *its own* identity files real and private; everything else symlinks back to your real `~/`. The provider is inferred from `--from-vault <tool>/<profile>`, or set explicitly with `--tool claude|codex|agy` (defaults to `claude`). On spawn, caam repoints `HOME` at the shallow profile and pins the provider's home var (`CODEX_HOME` / `GEMINI_HOME`) so a stray inherited value can't pull the real identity back in.

```bash
# Stage credentials in caam's vault first (one-time per account).
caam backup claude alice@example.com
caam backup codex  bob
caam backup agy    carol

# Create a shallow profile per identity, copying the credential out of the vault.
# --tool is inferred from the <tool>/<profile> part of --from-vault.
caam shallow-profile create alice --from-vault claude/alice@example.com
caam shallow-profile create bob   --from-vault codex/bob
caam shallow-profile create carol --from-vault agy/carol

# Spawn concurrent sessions, each pinned to its own identity and provider.
caam shallow-spawn alice -- claude  &   # session 1, alice's Claude quota
caam shallow-spawn bob   -- codex   &   # session 2, bob's Codex identity
caam shallow-spawn carol -- agy     &   # session 3, carol's Antigravity identity
wait
```

Layout under `~/orch-homes/<name>/` — **claude** (the `codex` and `agy` real-file sets are listed below):

| Path | Real or symlink? | Why |
|------|------------------|-----|
| `.claude/.credentials.json` | **real file** | The whole point: per-identity OAuth token. |
| `.claude/.credentials.lock` | **real file** | Per-identity flock target so two sessions don't serialize on a shared lock. |
| `.claude.json` | **real file** | Claude Code rewrites this on every run; a symlink would mutate the user's real settings under the shallow identity. |
| `.claude/projects/`, `.claude/todos/`, `.claude/shell-snapshots/` | symlink → `~/.claude/...` | Conversation history is shared. |
| `.bashrc`, `.zshrc`, `.gitconfig`, `.ssh/`, `.cargo/`, `.bun/`, `.config/`, `.docker/`, ... | symlink → `~/...` | Dev tooling, shell, git, ssh — all pass through. |

Per-provider real (private) files — everything else under the provider's home is symlinked through, so non-auth state (sessions, history, caches) stays shared:

| Provider | Real / private files | Spawn pins |
|----------|----------------------|------------|
| `claude` | `.claude/.credentials.json`, `.claude/.credentials.lock`, `.claude.json` | scrubs `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` |
| `codex`  | `.codex/auth.json`, `.codex/config.toml` (file credential store enforced) | `CODEX_HOME=<profile>/.codex` |
| `agy`    | `.gemini/antigravity-cli/antigravity-oauth-token` (+ optional `.gemini/google_accounts.json`, `.gemini/oauth_creds.json`, `.gemini/antigravity-cli/settings.json`) | `GEMINI_HOME=<profile>/.gemini` |

**Smart fallback:** if a candidate (e.g. `~/.cargo`) doesn't exist in your real `~/`, no symlink is created — no broken links for users who don't have a given tool installed.

**Use when:** Your orchestrator runs N Claude Code sessions in parallel and each one must hit a different account simultaneously. `caam profile add` would also work, but each profile gets a blank shell history, blank git config, and blank Claude conversation history — painful for real dev work. Shallow profiles preserve everything you'd want to share and isolate only the auth identity.

**Subcommands:**

```bash
caam shallow-profile create <name> [--tool claude|codex|agy] [--from-vault <tool>/<profile>] [--from-file <path>] [--force] [--json]
caam shallow-profile list [--json]
caam shallow-profile delete <name> [--force] [--json]
caam shallow-spawn <name> -- <cmd> [args...]
caam shallow-spawn <name> --print-env         # print HOME=... (and CODEX_HOME/GEMINI_HOME) without exec
caam shallow-spawn <name> --allow-agent-view -- claude   # keep Claude Code Agent View enabled (see note below)
caam shallow-spawn <name> --effort xhigh -- codex ...    # codex only: injects `-c model_reasoning_effort=xhigh` (codex has no --effort flag)
```

The base directory defaults to `~/orch-homes/`. Override with `$CAAM_SHALLOW_HOMES_DIR` or the `--base` flag (per-command, useful for tests).

**Worked example — 3-way Claude orchestration on a VPS:**

```bash
# One-time setup: log in once on each account through the normal Claude flow,
# back each one up to caam's vault.
for who in alice bob charlie; do
  /login                                # in claude → $who's google account
  caam backup claude "$who"
done

# Create three shallow identities pointing at those vault profiles.
for who in alice bob charlie; do
  caam shallow-profile create "$who" --from-vault "claude/$who"
done

# Fan three concurrent claude sessions. Each lands on its own quota,
# but all three share your real ~/.bashrc, ~/.gitconfig, ~/.ssh, AND
# ~/.claude/projects (so any session can see/resume any conversation).
caam shallow-spawn alice   -- claude --print "audit pkg/auth for race conditions"   &
caam shallow-spawn bob     -- claude --print "write tests for internal/shallow"     &
caam shallow-spawn charlie -- claude --print "draft release notes for v0.4.0"       &
wait
```

> **Claude Agent View is disabled by default in shallow sessions (issue #49).** Claude Code's Agent View feature (the `--bg` background-supervisor daemon) runs a **long-lived, cross-session** supervisor process that is **not** bound to the shallow profile's `HOME`. On resume, a shallow `claude` session would reconnect to an already-running supervisor bound to a *different* identity (typically the VM's primary Claude auth), silently bypassing shallow-spawn's per-identity auth isolation and using the wrong account. caam cannot control that daemon's lifecycle, so `caam shallow-spawn <name> -- claude` injects `CLAUDE_CODE_DISABLE_AGENT_VIEW=1` into the child environment by default. This keeps the session foreground and honoring the per-identity `~/.claude/.credentials.json`.
>
> **Escape hatches** (both opt back into Agent View, accepting the auth-isolation caveat above):
> - Pass `--allow-agent-view` on `shallow-spawn` — caam will not inject the disable flag for that invocation.
> - Export `CLAUDE_CODE_DISABLE_AGENT_VIEW` yourself (to any value) before spawning — caam never overrides an explicit user setting.
>
> This only affects the `claude` provider; `codex` and `agy` shallow sessions have no Agent View feature and are unchanged.

> **Note:** `caam shallow-profile` does not (yet) call any reverse-engineered Anthropic endpoints to display per-account live usage data. That's a separate concern tracked in the original report (issue #16) and intentionally deferred.

## Supported Tools

| Tool | Auth Location | Login Command |
|------|--------------|---------------|
| **Claude Code** | OAuth: `~/.claude/.credentials.json` + `~/.claude.json` + `~/.config/claude-code/auth.json` + (macOS) `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/config.json` • API key: `~/.claude/settings.json` | `/login` in CLI |
| **Codex CLI** | `~/.codex/auth.json` (file store enforced) | `codex login` (or `--device-auth`) |
| **Antigravity CLI** | OAuth: `~/.gemini/antigravity-cli/antigravity-oauth-token` (+ `~/.gemini/google_accounts.json`) | `agy` interactive (Google OAuth) |
| **Gemini CLI** (legacy) | OAuth: `~/.gemini/settings.json` (+ `oauth_creds.json`) • API key: `~/.gemini/.env` | `gemini` interactive |
| **Grok Build** (xAI) | OAuth/OIDC: `~/.grok/auth.json` (+ `~/.grok/config.toml`); respects `GROK_HOME` | `grok login` (browser OIDC) |

### Claude Code (Claude Max)

**Subscription:** Claude Max ($200/month)

**Auth Files:**
- `~/.claude/.credentials.json` — Claude Code OAuth credentials (primary)
- `~/.claude.json` — Session/account state
- `~/.config/claude-code/auth.json` — Secondary auth data
- `~/.claude/settings.json` — API key mode via `apiKeyHelper`
- `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/config.json` — macOS: Claude Desktop's encrypted OAuth token cache (only its `oauth:tokenCache*` fields are tracked, so recent Claude Code builds can't reassert the previous account after a switch)

**Login Command:** Inside Claude Code, type `/login`

**Notes:** Claude Max has a 5-hour rolling usage window. When you hit it, you'll see rate limit messages. Switch accounts to continue.

**Limitations:**
- **Email/Identity Detection:** Claude's current auth format does not expose email or account ID. Profile names default to timestamp-based auto-names (`auto-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS`) unless you specify a name when backing up.
- **Automatic Token Refresh:** Claude Code manages token refresh internally. CAAM cannot refresh Claude tokens—use `/login` in Claude Code if tokens expire.
- **Usage API:** Claude's usage API is undocumented and may not be reliable.

### Codex CLI (GPT Pro)

**Subscription:** GPT Pro ($200/month unlimited)

**Auth Files:**
- `~/.codex/auth.json` (or `$CODEX_HOME/auth.json`)

**Login Command:** `codex login` (or `codex login --device-auth` for headless)

**Notes:** Respects `CODEX_HOME`. CAAM enforces file-based auth storage by writing `cli_auth_credentials_store = "file"` to `~/.codex/config.toml` inside the profile.

> **Running a `codex app-server` daemon?** Codex can run as a long-lived daemon (`codex app-server`, also `codex mcp-server`) that caches `auth.json` in memory at startup. Swapping the auth file on disk does **not** change the account that daemon serves until it is restarted. After `caam activate/switch/next codex`, CAAM detects a running daemon and prints a warning. Pass `--reload-daemon` to have CAAM `SIGTERM` the daemon (it respawns with the new auth on next use) — it never kills a daemon silently.

### Gemini CLI (Google One AI Premium)

**Subscription:** Gemini Ultra ($275/month)

**Auth Files:**
- `~/.gemini/settings.json`
- `~/.gemini/oauth_creds.json` (OAuth cache)
- `~/.gemini/.env` (API key mode)

**Login Command:** Start `gemini`, select "Login with Google" or use `/auth` to switch modes

**Notes:** For CAAM, Gemini Ultra behaves like Claude Max and GPT Pro: OAuth tokens are stored locally and can be swapped instantly.

### Grok Build (xAI)

**Auth Files:**
- `~/.grok/auth.json` — login credential written by `grok login` (required)
- `~/.grok/config.toml` — CLI configuration (optional, travels with the account)

**Login Command:** `grok login` (browser OIDC via xAI accounts)

**Notes:** Respects `GROK_HOME` (documented override for the config directory, default `~/.grok`). Grok Build tokens expire after 7 days; run `grok login` to refresh — CAAM cannot refresh them.

**Caveats:**
- **`GROK_DEPLOYMENT_KEY` precedence:** in enterprise/deployment setups this environment variable takes precedence over `auth.json`, so a swapped profile is silently ignored while it is set.
- **`~/.grok` collision:** the unaffiliated community CLI [`superagent-ai/grok-cli`](https://github.com/superagent-ai/grok-cli) (npm `grok-dev`) also uses `~/.grok/` but stores its state in `grok.db` / `user-settings.json`. CAAM touches only the official Grok Build files (`auth.json`, `config.toml`), so the two CLIs can coexist.

## Quick Start

### 1. Backup Your Current Account

```bash
# After logging into Claude normally
caam backup claude alice@gmail.com
```

### 2. Add Another Account

```bash
caam clear claude                        # Remove current auth
claude                                   # Login as bob@gmail.com via /login
caam backup claude bob@gmail.com         # Save it
```

### 3. Switch Instantly

```bash
caam activate claude alice@gmail.com     # Back to Alice
caam activate claude bob@gmail.com       # Back to Bob
```

### 4. Check Status

```bash
$ caam status
claude: alice@gmail.com (active)
codex:  work@company.com (active)
gemini: (no auth files)

$ caam ls claude
alice@gmail.com
bob@gmail.com
carol@gmail.com
```

## Command Reference

### Auth File Swapping (Primary Use Case)

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `caam backup <tool> <email>` | Save current auth files to vault |
| `caam activate <tool> <email>` | Restore auth files from vault (instant switch!) |
| `caam status [tool]` | Show which profile is currently active |
| `caam ls [tool]` | List all saved profiles in vault |
| `caam delete <tool> <email>` | Remove a saved profile |
| `caam paths [tool]` | Show auth file locations for each tool |
| `caam clear <tool>` | Remove auth files (logout state) |
| `caam alias <tool> <profile> <alias>` | Create a short alias for a profile |
| `caam rename <tool> <old> <new>` | Copy profile to a new name (non-destructive) |
| `caam uninstall` | Restore originals from `_original` and remove caam data/config |

**Aliases:** `caam switch` is the activation alias and works like `caam activate`. Note that `caam use <provider> <profile>` is a separate command that sets the *default* profile for a provider (it does not switch active auth files).

### Quick Switch: `pick` + aliases

Use `caam pick` when you want the fastest possible profile swap:

```bash
caam pick claude           # fzf if installed; numbered prompt otherwise
caam pick                  # uses your default_provider if set
```

Set a default provider so you can omit the tool name:

```bash
caam config set default_provider claude
```

Aliases make long emails painless (works for `pick` and `activate`):

```bash
caam alias claude work-account-1 work
caam pick claude            # type "work" at the prompt
caam activate claude work   # alias resolution works here too
```

Rename auto-generated profiles to friendly names (non-destructive copy):

```bash
caam rename claude auto-20260121-143022 work   # Copy profile to "work"
caam rename claude old-name new-name           # Original preserved by default
caam rename claude temp main --delete-old -y   # Delete old after copying
```

SSH-safe fallback (no fzf, no TTY): use direct activation:

```bash
caam activate claude work-account-1
```

fzf one-liner (if you prefer piping):

```bash
sel=$(caam ls claude | fzf --prompt 'claude> ') && [ -n "$sel" ] && caam activate claude "$sel"
```

### Smart Profile Management

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `caam activate <tool> --auto` | Auto-select the best profile using rotation algorithm |
| `caam next <tool>` | Switch to the next profile in rotation (use `--dry-run` to preview without switching) |
| `caam quota [claude]` | Show cached usage per Claude profile, read from disk with no network (`--json` supported) |
| `caam run <tool> [-- args]` | Wrap CLI execution with automatic failover on rate limits |
| `caam cooldown set <provider/profile>` | Mark profile as rate-limited (default: 60min cooldown) |
| `caam cooldown list` | List active cooldowns with remaining time |
| `caam cooldown clear <provider/profile>` | Clear cooldown for a specific profile |
| `caam cooldown clear --all` | Clear all active cooldowns |
| `caam project set <tool> <profile>` | Associate current directory with a profile |
| `caam project show [tool]` | Show resolved associations for current directory (`get` is an alias; `--json` for machine-readable output) |
| `caam project list` | List all project associations (`--json` supported) |

**Options for `caam run`:**
- `--max-retries N` — Maximum retry attempts on rate limit (default: 1)
- `--cooldown DURATION` — Cooldown duration after rate limit (default: 60m)
- `--algorithm NAME` — Rotation algorithm: smart, round_robin, random
- `--policy NAME` — Rotation policy: availability (default), drain
- `--quiet` — Suppress profile switch notifications

**Rotation policies** (`--policy` on `caam precheck`, `caam next`, and `caam run`, or `stealth.rotation.policy` in `~/.caam/spm_config.yaml`):

- `availability` (default) — maximize immediate headroom; this is the existing behavior and remains unchanged unless you opt in to another policy.
- `drain` (opt-in) — prefer the profile whose included quota resets soonest, among profiles under a headroom ceiling (default: 95% used; configurable via `stealth.rotation.drain_headroom_ceiling`). This drains expiring subscription quota before it is lost instead of leaving it unused while a fresher account is consumed. Profiles at/above the ceiling or without a known reset time are held in reserve, ranked by availability. Selections include an explanation, e.g. `chose work: resets in 42m, 91% used; fallback personal held in reserve`. Pair with `--usage-aware` on `caam next` so reset times are fetched.

**Options for `caam activate`:**
- `--auto` — Use rotation algorithm to pick best profile
- `--backup-current` — Backup current auth before switching
- `--force` — Activate even if profile is in cooldown

When `stealth.cooldown.enabled` is true in config, `caam activate` warns if the target profile is in cooldown and prompts for confirmation. Use `--force` to bypass.

When `stealth.rotation.enabled` is true, `caam activate <tool>` automatically falls back to rotation if the default profile is in cooldown.

### Uninstall Notes

`caam uninstall` restores auth from any available `_original` backups first, then removes caam’s data/config. Useful flags:

- `--dry-run` shows what would be restored/removed
- `--keep-backups` keeps the vault after restoring originals
- `--force` skips the confirmation prompt

### Profile Isolation (Advanced)

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `caam profile add <tool> <email>` | Create isolated profile directory |
| `caam profile ls [tool]` | List isolated profiles |
| `caam profile delete <tool> <email>` | Delete isolated profile |
| `caam profile status <tool> <email>` | Show isolated profile status |
| `caam login <tool> <email>` | Run login flow for isolated profile |
| `caam exec <tool> <email> [-- args]` | Run CLI with isolated profile |

## Smart Profile Management

When you have multiple accounts across multiple providers, manually tracking which account has headroom, which one just hit a limit, and which one you used recently becomes tedious. Smart Profile Management automates this decision-making so you can focus on coding instead of account juggling.

### Profile Health Scoring

Each profile displays a health indicator showing its current state at a glance:

| Icon | Status | Meaning |
|------|--------|---------|
| 🟢 | Healthy | Token valid for >1 hour, no recent errors |
| 🟡 | Warning | Token expiring within 1 hour, or minor issues |
| 🔴 | Critical | Token expired, or repeated errors in the last hour |
| ⚪ | Unknown | No health data available yet |

Health scoring combines multiple factors:
- **Token expiry**: How long until the OAuth token expires
- **Error history**: Recent authentication or rate limit errors
- **Penalty score**: Accumulated issues with automatic decay over time
- **Plan type**: Enterprise/Pro plans get slight scoring boosts

The penalty system uses **exponential decay** (20% reduction every 5 minutes) so temporary issues don't permanently mark a profile as unhealthy. After about 30 minutes of no errors, a profile's penalty score returns to near zero.

### Cached Usage: `caam quota`

`caam quota` shows how much of each Claude account's usage windows is spent, **without touching the network**:

```
PROFILE           EMAIL  PLAN  5H                WEEKLY            FABLE             RESETS           AS OF
● adriana-gmail   n/a    Pro   █████░░░░░   53%  █░░░░░░░░░   11%  ██░░░░░░░░   19%  Fri Sep 4 08:00  18m ago
  adriana-syneto  n/a    Pro   ░░░░░░░░░░ ~  0%  ░░░░░░░░░░ ~  4%  ░░░░░░░░░░ ~  3%  Wed Sep 2 20:59  3h ago
  vadim           n/a    Pro   ░░░░░░░░░░ ~  0%  ███░░░░░░░ ~ 29%  █████░░░░░ ~ 54%  Wed Sep 2 10:00  3h ago

usage as cached by Claude Code; refreshed by that account's own sessions. No network.
```

Claude Code already caches each account's utilization in that account's own `.claude.json`. `caam quota` reads those files and nothing else. `caam limits`, by contrast, answers the same question by presenting every profile's bearer token from one process — one machine speaking for several accounts at once, which is the shared-credential pattern that gets subscriptions revoked. Reading the cache avoids that entirely.

The trade-off is freshness: a profile's numbers only move when that profile itself runs a session. Every row states its own age, and marks figures taken from a frozen vault snapshot with `~`. The active profile is read from the live `~/.claude.json`, so its numbers are as current as your last turn.

Reading the table:

- `●` marks the active profile; rows tagged `(shallow)` are shallow profiles.
- **5H** is the rolling 5-hour session window; **WEEKLY** is the all-model weekly cap; the third bar is the weekly cap for the model named in its header.
- A window whose reset time has already passed reads 0%: it rolled over, and nothing has run against it since.
- **RESETS** is when the weekly window rolls over; **AS OF** is how stale the snapshot is.
- `--json` emits the same data per profile, including `source` (`live`, `snapshot`, or `shallow`), `account_uuid`, `fetched_at`, and each window's `percent`, `resets_at`, and `rolled`.

Only Claude caches usage on disk. `caam quota <other-provider>` exits 1 and points you at `caam limits`.

### Smart Rotation Algorithms

When you run `caam activate claude --auto`, the rotation system picks the best profile for you. Three algorithms are available:

**Smart (Default)**: Multi-factor scoring that considers:
- Cooldown state (profiles in cooldown are excluded)
- Health status (prefers healthy profiles)
- Recency (avoids profiles used in the last 30 minutes)
- Plan type (slight preference for higher-tier plans)
- Random jitter (breaks ties unpredictably)

**Round Robin**: Simple sequential rotation through profiles, skipping any in cooldown. Predictable and even distribution.

**Random**: Purely random selection among non-cooldown profiles. Least predictable but may cluster usage.

Configure the algorithm in `~/.caam/config.yaml`:

```yaml
stealth:
  rotation:
    enabled: true
    algorithm: smart  # smart | round_robin | random
```

### Cooldown Tracking

When an account hits a rate limit, you can mark it as "in cooldown" so rotation algorithms skip it:

```bash
# Mark current Claude profile as rate-limited (default: 60 min cooldown)
caam cooldown set claude

# Or specify a profile and duration
caam cooldown set claude/work@company.com --minutes 120

# View active cooldowns
caam cooldown list

# Clear a cooldown early
caam cooldown clear claude/work@company.com
```

When cooldown enforcement is enabled (`stealth.cooldown.enabled: true`), attempting to activate a profile in cooldown will warn you and prompt for confirmation. This prevents accidentally switching back to an account that just hit limits.

### Automatic Failover with `caam run`

The `caam run` command wraps your AI CLI execution and automatically handles rate limits:

```bash
# Instead of running claude directly:
caam run claude -- "explain this code"

# If Claude hits a rate limit mid-session:
# 1. Current profile goes into cooldown
# 2. Next best profile is automatically selected
# 3. Command is re-executed with new account
```

For seamless integration, add shell aliases:

```bash
alias claude='caam run claude --'
alias codex='caam run codex --'
alias gemini='caam run gemini --'
```

Now you can use `claude "explain this code"` and rate limits are handled transparently.

Configuration options:
```bash
caam run claude --max-retries 2 --cooldown 90m --algorithm smart -- "your prompt"
```

### Project-Profile Associations

Link specific profiles to project directories so you don't have to remember which account to use where:

```bash
# In your work project directory
cd ~/projects/work-app
caam project set claude work@company.com

# Now whenever you're in this directory (or subdirectories)
caam activate claude  # Automatically uses work@company.com

# The TUI also shows the project association
caam tui
# Status bar shows: Project: ~/projects/work-app → work@company.com
```

Associations cascade: if you set an association on `/home/user/projects`, it applies to all subdirectories unless a more specific association exists.

In the TUI, press `p` to set the current profile as the default for your current directory.

### Preview Rotation Selection

Before committing to a rotation selection, preview what the algorithm would pick:

```bash
$ caam next claude
Recommended: bob@gmail.com
  + Healthy token (expires in 4h 32m)
  + Not used recently (2h ago)

Alternatives:
  alice@gmail.com - Used recently (15m ago)

In cooldown:
  carol@gmail.com - In cooldown (45m remaining)
```

This is useful for understanding why rotation is making certain choices, or for scripting conditional logic around account selection.

## Workflow Examples

### Daily Workflow

```bash
# Morning: Check what's active
caam status
# claude: alice@gmail.com (active)
# codex:  work@company.com (active)
# gemini: personal@gmail.com (active)

# Afternoon: Hit Claude usage limit
caam activate claude bob@gmail.com
# Activated claude profile 'bob@gmail.com'

claude  # Continue working immediately with new account
```

### Initial Multi-Account Setup

```bash
# 1. Login to first account using normal flow
claude
# Inside Claude: /login → authenticate with alice@gmail.com

# 2. Backup the auth using the email as the profile name
caam backup claude alice@gmail.com

# 3. Clear and login to second account
caam clear claude
claude
# Inside Claude: /login → authenticate with bob@gmail.com

# 4. Backup that too
caam backup claude bob@gmail.com

# 5. Now you can switch instantly forever!
caam activate claude alice@gmail.com   # < 100ms
caam activate claude bob@gmail.com     # < 100ms
```

### Parallel Sessions Setup

```bash
# Create isolated profiles
caam profile add codex work@company.com
caam profile add codex personal@gmail.com

# Login to each (one-time, uses browser)
caam login codex work@company.com      # Opens browser for work account
caam login codex personal@gmail.com    # Opens browser for personal account

# Run simultaneously in different terminals
caam exec codex work@company.com -- "implement auth system"
caam exec codex personal@gmail.com -- "review PR #123"
```

### Smart Rotation Workflow

```bash
# Let rotation pick the best profile automatically
caam activate claude --auto
# Using rotation: claude/bob@gmail.com
# Recommended: bob@gmail.com
#   + Healthy token (expires in 4h 32m)
#   + Not used recently (2h ago)

# Hit a rate limit during your session? Mark it
caam cooldown set claude
# Recorded cooldown for claude/bob@gmail.com until 14:30 (58m remaining)

# Next activation automatically picks another profile
caam activate claude --auto
# Using rotation: claude/alice@gmail.com
# Recommended: alice@gmail.com
#   + Healthy status
# In cooldown:
#   bob@gmail.com - In cooldown (57m remaining)
```

### Zero-Friction Mode with `caam run`

```bash
# Add aliases to your .bashrc/.zshrc
alias claude='caam run claude --'
alias codex='caam run codex --'

# Now just use the tool normally
claude "explain this authentication flow"

# If you hit a rate limit mid-session, caam automatically:
# 1. Marks current profile as in cooldown
# 2. Selects next best profile via rotation
# 3. Re-runs your command with the new profile
# All transparent - you just see the output
```

## FAQ

**Q: Does this work with API keys / pay-per-token plans?**

No. This tool is specifically designed for **fixed-cost subscription plans** like Claude Max ($200/month), GPT Pro ($200/month), and Gemini Ultra ($275/month). These plans authenticate via OAuth browser flows and store tokens locally. If you're using API keys with usage-based billing, you don't need account switching—you'd just use different API keys.

**Q: Is this against terms of service?**

No. You're using your own legitimately-purchased subscriptions. `caam` just manages local auth files—it doesn't share accounts, bypass rate limits, or modify API traffic. Each account still respects its individual usage limits.

**Q: What if the tool updates and changes auth file locations?**

Run `caam paths` to see current locations. If they change in a tool update, we'll update `caam`. File an issue if you notice a discrepancy.

**Q: Can I sync the vault across machines?**

With care — and `caam sync` is now provider-aware about what is safe to move. Claude and Codex subscription OAuth uses a **rotating refresh-token family**: every refresh consumes the current refresh token, and replaying a stale copy from another machine can trip the provider's reuse detection and revoke the whole family (this bricked a real account — see issue #19). So by default those providers are **host-local**: `caam sync` replicates their profile *metadata* (so every machine knows the logical account exists) but never their credential payload — each machine keeps its own independent grant via `caam add`. Gemini, OpenCode, and Cursor keep the old bidirectional `replicate` behavior. You can override per provider or per profile in `~/.config/caam/config.json`:

```json
{
  "sync_policy": {
    "providers": { "codex": "replicate" },
    "profiles":  { "claude/build-host": "replicate" }
  }
}
```

Forcing `replicate` for a rotating provider prints a loud warning whenever both machines already hold diverged copies, because converging them is exactly the revocation hazard. `caam sync status` shows the resolved policy per provider.

**Q: What's the difference between vault profiles and isolated profiles?**

- **Vault profiles** (`backup`/`activate`): Swap auth files in place. Simple, instant, one account active at a time per tool.
- **Isolated profiles** (`profile add`/`exec`): Full directory isolation with pseudo-HOME. Run multiple accounts simultaneously in parallel terminals.

**Q: Will this break my existing sessions?**

Switching profiles while a CLI is running may cause auth errors in the running session. Best practice: switch accounts before starting a new session, not during.

**Q: How do I know which account I'm currently using?**

Run `caam status`. It shows the active profile (email) for each tool based on content hash matching.

## Installation

### Recommended: Homebrew (macOS/Linux)

```bash
brew install dicklesworthstone/tap/caam
```

This method provides:
- Automatic updates via `brew upgrade`
- Dependency management
- Easy uninstall via `brew uninstall`

### Windows: Scoop

```powershell
scoop bucket add dicklesworthstone https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/scoop-bucket
scoop install dicklesworthstone/caam
```

### Alternative: Direct Download

Releases ship as versioned archives (one `.tar.gz` per Unix platform, a `.zip` for
Windows) on the [releases page](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/coding_agent_account_manager/releases/latest).
Download the archive matching your platform, extract it, and put the `caam`
binary on your `PATH`:

| Platform | Asset |
|----------|-------|
| Linux x86_64 | `caam_<version>_linux_amd64.tar.gz` |
| Linux ARM64 | `caam_<version>_linux_arm64.tar.gz` |
| macOS Intel | `caam_<version>_darwin_amd64.tar.gz` |
| macOS ARM | `caam_<version>_darwin_arm64.tar.gz` |
| Windows x86_64 | `caam_<version>_windows_amd64.zip` |

For example, on Linux x86_64:

```bash
ver=$(curl -fsSL https://api.github.com/repos/Dicklesworthstone/coding_agent_account_manager/releases/latest | grep -oP '"tag_name":\s*"v\K[^"]+')
curl -fsSL -o caam.tar.gz "https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/coding_agent_account_manager/releases/latest/download/caam_${ver}_linux_amd64.tar.gz"
tar -xzf caam.tar.gz && sudo install caam /usr/local/bin/
```

If you don't want to pick an asset by hand, the install script above downloads,
verifies, and installs the right archive for your platform automatically.

### Verify Release Artifacts

Each release ships a `SHA256SUMS` file signed with
[minisign](https://jedisct1.github.io/minisign/) (releases v0.1.18 and later).
The signing key is held by the maintainer:

```
untrusted comment: caam release signing key (minisign key 1BBD79B28BF718D0)
RWTQGPeLsnm9G7VFdFWkkcRi3wJK/PqsYxWC+oLNN74W9IjBxRU1Xu70
```

To verify a release by hand, download `SHA256SUMS`, `SHA256SUMS.minisig`, and
your platform archive from the release page, then:

```bash
# 1. Verify the signature on the checksums file
minisign -Vm SHA256SUMS -P RWTQGPeLsnm9G7VFdFWkkcRi3wJK/PqsYxWC+oLNN74W9IjBxRU1Xu70

# 2. Verify the archive against the signed checksums
sha256sum -c SHA256SUMS --ignore-missing
# macOS fallback:
# shasum -a 256 -c SHA256SUMS --ignore-missing
```

The same public key is embedded in the `caam` binary itself, so `caam update`
performs this verification in pure Go — fail-closed, with no external tools
required.

**Trust model.** Releases up to v0.1.17 were built by GitHub Actions and
signed keylessly with cosign, pinned to the release workflow's OIDC identity
(`.github/workflows/release.yml@refs/tags/<tag>`, issuer
`token.actions.githubusercontent.com`). Releases moved off GitHub Actions
permanently, and that identity is unattainable outside Actions — no non-CI
release could ever verify (see issue #77). From v0.1.18, releases are built on
maintainer-controlled hosts and signed with the maintainer-held minisign key
above; what you trust is that key (and this README/binary pinning it) rather
than GitHub's CI identity chain. Verification is strictly fail-closed in both
the updater and the install script. For old releases (≤ v0.1.17) the legacy
cosign verification still applies:

```bash
cosign verify-blob \
  --bundle SHA256SUMS.sig \
  --certificate-oidc-issuer https://token.actions.githubusercontent.com \
  --certificate-identity "https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/coding_agent_account_manager/.github/workflows/release.yml@refs/tags/vX.Y.Z" \
  SHA256SUMS
```

### Alternative: Install Script

```bash
curl -fsSL "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Dicklesworthstone/coding_agent_account_manager/main/install.sh?$(date +%s)" | bash
```

### From Source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/coding_agent_account_manager
cd coding_agent_account_manager
go build -o caam ./cmd/caam
sudo mv caam /usr/local/bin/
```

### Go Install

```bash
go install github.com/Dicklesworthstone/coding_agent_account_manager/cmd/caam@latest
```

## Tips

1. **Use the actual email address as the profile name** — it's self-documenting and you'll never forget which account is which
2. **Backup before clearing:** `caam backup claude current@email.com && caam clear claude`
3. **Check status often:** `caam status` shows what's active across all tools
4. **Use --backup-current flag:** `caam activate claude new@email.com --backup-current` auto-saves current state before switching

## Acknowledgments

Special thanks to **[@darvell](https://github.com/darvell)** for inspiring this project and for the feature ideas behind Smart Profile Management. His work on **[codex-pool](https://github.com/darvell/codex-pool)**—a sophisticated proxy that load-balances requests across multiple AI accounts with automatic failover—demonstrated how much intelligence can be added to account management.

While codex-pool answers "which account should handle THIS request?" (real-time proxy), caam answers "which account should I USE for my work session?" (profile manager). The Smart Profile Management features adapt codex-pool's intelligence to caam's architecture:

- **Proactive Token Refresh** — Automatically refreshes OAuth tokens before they expire, preventing mid-session auth failures *(not available for Claude—use `/login` to re-authenticate)*
- **Profile Health Scoring** — Visual indicators (🟢🟡🔴) showing token status, error history, penalty decay, and plan type *(Claude profiles may show limited identity info)*
- **Smart Rotation** — Multi-factor algorithm picks the best available profile based on health, cooldown, recency, and usage patterns
- **Cooldown Tracking** — Database-backed tracking of rate limit hits with configurable cooldown windows
- **Automatic Failover** — The `caam run` wrapper detects rate limits and seamlessly switches to another account
- **Usage Analytics** — Track activation patterns and session durations across profiles
- **Hot Reload** — TUI auto-refreshes when profiles are added/modified in another terminal
- **Project-Profile Associations** — Remember which profile to use for each project directory

See [`docs/SMART_PROFILE_MANAGEMENT.md`](docs/SMART_PROFILE_MANAGEMENT.md) for the full design document.

## Contributions

> *About Contributions:* Please don't take this the wrong way, but I do not accept outside contributions for any of my projects. I simply don't have the mental bandwidth to review anything, and it's my name on the thing, so I'm responsible for any problems it causes; thus, the risk-reward is highly asymmetric from my perspective. I'd also have to worry about other "stakeholders," which seems unwise for tools I mostly make for myself for free. Feel free to submit issues, and even PRs if you want to illustrate a proposed fix, but know I won't merge them directly. Instead, I'll have Claude or Codex review submissions via `gh` and independently decide whether and how to address them. Bug reports in particular are welcome. Sorry if this offends, but I want to avoid wasted time and hurt feelings. I understand this isn't in sync with the prevailing open-source ethos that seeks community contributions, but it's the only way I can move at this velocity and keep my sanity.
